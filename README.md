## For Ops:
Add a dictionary to `doors.py` - it should be called "`n`th_level" and include: 
- int "floor" for which floor you are creating options for
- "first_door" and what's behind it, str
- "second_door" and what's behind it, str
- "third_door" and what's behind it, str
- "correct_answer" int for the right answer to move upstairs

Once you've created a level, add the level to the `levels` dictionary in `doors.py`. Have fun!
